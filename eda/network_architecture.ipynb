This is an example of a reflex, which is an involuntary muscular response elicited by the rubber hammer tapping the associated tendon. When reflex responses are absent this could be a clue that the spinal cord, nerve root, peripheral nerve, or muscle has been damaged. When reflex response is abnormal, it may be due to the disruption of the sensory (feeling) or motor (movement) nerves or both. To determine where the neural problem may be, the physician tests reflexes in different parts of the body. See the following examples in the chart below.', 'Check the deep tendon reflexes using impulses from a reflex hammer to stretch the muscle and tendon. The limbs should be in a relaxed and symmetric position, since these factors can influence reflex amplitude.

Scientific use of the term reflex refers to a behavior that is mediated via the reflex arc; this does not apply to casual uses of the term reflex.', 'Reflexes are little movements of the muscle when the tendon is tapped. A reflex can be decreased or absent if there is a problem with the nerve supply. To test your reflexes, your doctor will use a rubber hammer to tap firmly on the tendon. Just as your muscles receive signals through certain nerves, other nerves carry signals back to your spinal cord from specific sections of your skin and other tissues.

Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests.', \"Ans: An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slips suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake. \", \"Earthquakes occur because of the movements of the tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are large, flat pieces of stone that form the Earth's crust. These tectonic plates are actually moving in slow motion. Movement of the Earth's crust along the plate margins causes up-heaving and instability in land or ocean masses. Plate Tectonics is what this movement of the Earth's crust is called. The Earth's plates are constantly moving and can push together in places. Sometimes they get into a traffic jam.\", \"The shaking motion of an earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy. Earthquakes are caused when stress, building up within rocks of the earth's crust, is released in a sudden jolt. Rocks crack and slip past each other causing the ground to vibrate.

Lyme Disease Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. Some people never develop a bull’s-eye rash. Some people only develop arthritis, and for others nervous system problems are the only symptom of Lyme disease. Many of the symptoms of Lyme disease are similar to those of other diseases.', 'The number of US counties experiencing high incidence of Lyme disease has grown considerably from 1993 through 2012, according to a study published online July 15 and in the August issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Proteins are synthesized as a primary sequence and then fold into secondary → tertiary → and quaternary structures.\", \"The primary structure is simply a long chain of peptides (polypeptide chain). The peptide monomers are like letters in a long, long word (the polypeptide). The word, a product … of the primary structure and the peptide bonding sequence means something-whether it be, I'm a transport protein. or I'm an enzyme!. The function of a protein is directly related to its structure. For example, a protein that fights a certain bacteria might have a shape that allows it to bind to the bacteria and then destroy it.\", 'The quaternary structure of a protein is the spatial conformation caused by interactions between the polypeptide chains that form the protein. Only proteins made up of two or more polypeptide chains have a quaternary structure. Insulin (two chains), hemoglobin (four chains) and immunoglobulins (antibodies, four chains) are some examples of protein with a quaternary structure. Any changes in the structure of a protein are relevant if they alter its biological activity. Changes in the primary structure of a protein are the most important because they are modifications in the composition of the molecule, and that composition determines all the other structures of', 'Each bead is a small molecule called an amino acid. There are 20 standard amino acids, each with its own shape, size, and properties. Proteins typically contain from 50 to 2,000 amino acids hooked end-to-end in many combinations. Each protein has its own sequence of amino acids. Proteins are made of amino acids hooked end-to-end like beads on a necklace. To become active, proteins must twist and fold into their final, or native, conformation.. This final shape enables proteins to accomplish their function in your body', 'Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence — that is, the prediction of its folding and its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure from its primary structure.

The non-polar amino acids would fold into the  interior of the protein during protei … n folding, because they are  hydrophobic. A protein consists of a primary structure, which  consists of the amino acid chain. The secondary structure is how  the amino acids join together into alpha helices and beta pleated  chains and form hydrogen bonds. The function of a protein is directly related to its structure. For example, a protein that fights a certain bacteria might have a shape that allows it to bind to the bacteria and then destroy it.', 'All properties of a protein are derived from the primary structure, the linear sequence. Encoded in the sequence is the ability of the protein to fold into its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, and thus to be able to carry out a function. There are four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. These levels also reflect their temporal sequence. Proteins are synthesized as a primary sequence and then fold into secondary → tertiary → and quaternary structures.', 'The secondary structure of a protein is generated by the way in which its amino acids interact through the intermolecular bond. These interactions create a spatial conformation of the polypeptide chain. The two most studied secondary conformations of proteins are the alpha-helix and the beta-sheet. Any changes in the structure of a protein are relevant if they alter its biological activity.

It is a silvery grey, lustrous, and ductile metal found in zirconium minerals. Hafnium is also corrosion resistant, but zirconium impurities affect its physical properties and its nuclear properties, in particular. Due to their chemical similarity, hafnium and zirconium are difficult to separate. Given that hafnium absorbs neutrons, it is used in nuclear reactors control rods. As an alloying agent, the element is also used in niobium, titanium, iron, and other metals. Hafnium is employed in high-temperature ceramics and alloys because some compounds of the element are refractory.', 'Hafnium metal has no known toxicity. The metal is completely insoluble in water, saline solutions or body chemicals. Exposure to hafnium can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and eye or skin contact. Overexposure to hafnium and its compounds may cause mild irritation of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. It restists corrosion due to formation of a tough, impenetrable oxide film on its surface.

', \"Two are located on the surface of the thyroid, the other two are either on the surface or buried inside. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) works with vitamin D to regulate the amounts of calcium that go into bone & teeth and float around in the blood. Normally about 90% of your body's calcium is in your skeleton. If your parathyroids become overactive, some of the calcium that should go into your bones stays in your blood instead. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin regulate blood calcium levels. PTH increases the calcium concentration in the blood, and calcitonin decreases it.\", 'The thyroid gland regulates the body’s metabolism, while parathyroid glands regulate calcium levels and have no effect on metabolism. Parathyroid Hormone. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has a very powerful influence on the cells of your bones by causing them to release their calcium into the bloodstream. 1 PTH regulates how much calcium is absorbed from your diet, how much calcium is excreted by your kidneys, and how much calcium is stored in your bones. 2  We store many pounds of calcium in our bones, and it is readily available to the rest of the body at the request of the parathyroid glands.', 'Parathyroid Glands: Essentials. 1  Parathyroid hormone regulates the body’s calcium levels. 2  There are four parathyroid glands, and they are each about the size of a grain of rice. 3  Though they’re located near each other, the parathyroid glands are not related to the thyroid gland. 1 PTH regulates how much calcium is absorbed from your diet, how much calcium is excreted by your kidneys, and how much calcium is stored in your bones. 2  We store many pounds of calcium in our bones, and it is readily available to the rest of the body at the request of the parathyroid glands.', 'Mountain Soil is common in India and is mainly found in the areas of Himalaya Mountains.
